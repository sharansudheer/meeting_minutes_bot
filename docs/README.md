# Miss Minutes

### Introduction:-&#x20;

Version 1.0.0 - The Beginning&#x20;

"An Interactive Bot for Summarisation and Searching through Meeting Minutes(Aiming for the Software Industry)"

The plan here is to build a Bare Bone Web App that is intended to be deployed on site due to privacy issues related to the data being processed and handled in this app.

* The primary source of data set for the training of the "Summarisation" module is from [https://meetingbank.github.io/](https://meetingbank.github.io/)&#x20;
* MVC Flask App that uses PostgreSQL for caching and handling JSON objects
* Using T5, Text to Text Transformer model for training the Summarisation Module [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model\_doc/t5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/t5)&#x20;
* Using a Self Deployed Mistral AI LLM container for Chat Bot functionalities. [https://docs.mistral.ai/deployment/self-deployment/overview/](https://docs.mistral.ai/deployment/self-deployment/overview/)

Purely an InHouse Idea, I am not sure about the Caveats of this bot, features will be added in upcoming sprints.

Not Open For Contributions, as I am Brainstorming through the scale and functionalities of the app, as a part of Research and Development.
